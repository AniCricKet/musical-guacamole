    "This question involves creating three static methods in a class named DiverseArray. The first method, arraySum calculates the sum of entries in a specified one-dimensional array. The second method, rowSums, calculates sums of each row in a given two-dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The third method, isDiverse, determines if a given two-dimensional array is diverse, meaning no two rows have the same sum. Approach: (a) For arraySum, you need to iterate through the one-dimensional array and calculate the sum of its entries. (b) For rowSums, use the arraySum method appropriately. Iterate through each row of the two-dimensional array and use arraySum to calculate the sum of each row.(c) For isDiverse, use rowSums appropriately. Calculate the row sums for the given two-dimensional array and check if all row sums are unique, returning true if they are and false otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this question, the task was to implement a series of static methods that operate on both one dimensional and two dimensional arrays. Part (a) focused on creating a static method, `arraySum`, to calculate and return the sum of entries in a 1D array. Part (b) used a method, `rowSums`, to calculate the sums of each row in a 2D array and return them in a 1D array. Finally, part (c) required a new method, `isDiverse`, to determine if a given 2D array is diverse, meaning that no two rows have the same sum. I think I understood this FRQ pretty well as I've spent a lot of time studying Arrays and Array lists, when I examined some pretty similar questions during the FRQ Mini-lab earlier this year."
