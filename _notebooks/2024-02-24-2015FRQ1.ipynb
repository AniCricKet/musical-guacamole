    "This question involves creating three static methods in a class named DiverseArray. The first method, arraySum calculates the sum of entries in a specified one-dimensional array. The second method, rowSums, calculates sums of each row in a given two-dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The third method, isDiverse, determines if a given two-dimensional array is diverse, meaning no two rows have the same sum. Approach: (a) For arraySum, you need to iterate through the one-dimensional array and calculate the sum of its entries. (b) For rowSums, use the arraySum method appropriately. Iterate through each row of the two-dimensional array and use arraySum to calculate the sum of each row.(c) For isDiverse, use rowSums appropriately. Calculate the row sums for the given two-dimensional array and check if all row sums are unique, returning true if they are and false otherwise."
