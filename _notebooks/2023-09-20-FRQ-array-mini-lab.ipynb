    "To code a Java static method called arraySum for calculating the sum of entries in a specified one-dimensional array, I would start by defining the method within a Java class. The method would take an integer array as a parameter. Inside the method, I would initialize a variable, such as sum, to zero. Then, I'd use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the input array, adding each element's value to the sum in each iteration. After processing all the elements, I would return the sum as the result. Next, I would create a main method or use an existing one to demonstrate the usage of the arraySum method. Inside main, I would declare an example array (in this case, arr1) with the provided data. Finally, I would call the arraySum method with arr1 as an argument and print the returned sum to the console using System.out.println. This approach would allow the code to calculate and display the sum of the elements in the arr1 array, as specified in the prompt."

    "Approaching the task of coding the rowSums method involves analyzing the problem statement and understanding the requirement to calculate the sums of rows in a two-dimensional array. The initial steps would include defining the method's signature and establishing variables for tracking the number of rows and the resulting array for storing row sums. A nested loop structure would be implemented to iterate through each row and its elements, calculating the sum for each row and recording it in the result array. This comprehensive approach would ensure that the method correctly handles the task of summing rows in the input array, with comments providing clarity throughout the code. Thorough testing, including edge cases, would be conducted to validate the code's correctness and robustness."

    "To code the isDiverse method, I'd begin by understanding the problem: we want to determine if all rows in a two-dimensional array have different sums. I'd import the necessary tools and create the isDiverse method, which takes the array as input. Inside the method, I'd use two lists to keep track of the sums we've encountered. I'd then iterate through each row, calculating its sum. If I encounter a sum that's been seen before, I'd conclude that the array is not diverse and stop. But if every sum is unique, I'd consider the array diverse and return \"true.\" I'd add comments to clarify each part of the code and conduct thorough testing to ensure it works reliably with various input arrays."
