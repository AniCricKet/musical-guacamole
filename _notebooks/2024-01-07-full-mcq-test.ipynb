    "Overall, the test went fairly well. While some questions posed challenges, I felt confident in my ability to navigate through the majority of them. The questions that proved to be particularly difficult often required a deeper level of analysis, and in those instances, I applied various problem-solving strategies to the best of my ability. For example, questions that involved complex algorithms or required a more nuanced understanding of certain programming paradigms proved to be trickier than anticipated. I also realized that some of my errors stemmed from misinterpreting the logic within certain code snippets or overlooking specific nuances embedded in the questions. It is this awareness that prompts me to utilize the upcoming winter break as an opportune time for targeted practice.\n",

    "## Question 14:\n",
    "<img width=\"801\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-22 at 6 51 31 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/c46d10d9-6080-4b01-9589-b22425e15691\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, you were supposed to identify the potential error in the \"biggest\" method. I chose the incorrect answer, Option D, when the correct answer was Option C. I mistakenly thought that the method might not work correctly when both \"a\" and \"c\" have equal values. However, the actual issue lies in the comparison between \"a\" and \"b\" in the second condition of the first \"else if\" statement. The method may not work correctly when \"a\" and \"b\" have equal values because in such a case, it would return the value of \"b\" instead of \"a.\" This is why the correct answer is Option C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: Consider the example where a = 5, b = 3, and c = 5. In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than c and the second boolean condition evaluates to false since b is not greater than a, and the value of c is returned, which is the greatest of all three integers. Consider the second example where a = 5, b = 6, and c = 5. In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than b and the second boolean condition evaluates to true since b is greater than a and b is greater than c,  and the value of b is returned which is the greatest of the three values. Consider the third example where a = 5, b = 5, and c = 5. In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than b and the second boolean condition evaluates to false since b is  not greater than a,  and the else is executed so the value of c is returned. Since all three values were equal any of the values could be returned as the greatest of the three values.\n",

    "For this question, you were supposed to determine the value returned from a call to the \"doWhat\" method with a positive integer parameter. I chose the incorrect answer, Option C, when the correct answer was Option D. I mistakenly thought that the method was summing even integers, but it was actually summing odd integers between 1 and the given parameter \"num.\" The loop in the method increments by 2, ensuring that it includes only odd integers. This is why the correct answer is Option D, representing the sum of all odd integers between 1 and num, inclusive.\n",

I mistakenly thought that the method was printing substrings excluding the first character. However, the method actually prints substrings including the first character but excluding the last one. Therefore, the correct answer is Option D, representing the printed substrings:\n",

    "\n",
    "After two passes of the for loop, the array `arr` would be {3, 4, 5, 2, 1}. During each pass, the algorithm compares the current element with the elements before it and swaps them if necessary. In this case, the array is sorted in ascending order after two passes, resulting in Option C being the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: This insertion sort method begins sorting the array from the beginning putting the first three numbers in order during the first two passes. Only 3, 4, and 5 will be in the right order.\n",

    "## Question 24:\n",
    "<img width=\"830\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-22 at 6 54 40 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/40083f91-2fec-49b4-a1db-dc4d8d9db67a\">\n",

    "\n",
    "I mistakenly thought that both the methods with signatures `public void one(int value)` (Option I) and `public void one(String first, int second)` (Option II) could be added. However, the correct answer is Option D, as only the methods with signatures `public void one(String first, int second)` (Option II) and `public void one(int first, int second, int third)` (Option III) can be added without causing a compile-time error. The reason is that the method signatures must be distinct, and Option I conflicts with the existing method `public void one(int first)` in the `SomeMethods` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: Choice I will cause a compiler error if added to the SomeMethods class because it has the same method signature as public void one (int first), since it has the same name (one) and each parameter list consists of a single int parameter. Choice III can be added to the SomeMethods class because there are three int parameters and no other method named one has three int parameters\n",

    "For this question, you were supposed to determine the value of the array `data` after three passes of the outer loop. I chose the incorrect answer, Option B, when the correct answer was Option A.\n",
    "\n",
    "After three passes of the outer loop, the array `data` will be sorted in increasing order. The correct answer is Option A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The sorting algorithm correctly compares and swaps elements, leading to the sorted order as indicated in Option A.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this question, I selected option B, thinking that the second code segment alone would be sufficient to replace the missing code in the `getCost` method. However, the correct choice is actually option D, which combines the first and second code segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct code segment to replace the missing code in the `getCost` method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (numBoxes >= 10) {\n",
    "    totalCost = numBoxes * 1.50;\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (numBoxes >= 5) {\n",
    "    totalCost = numBoxes * 3.00;\n",

    "    totalCost = numBoxes * 5.00;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the correct pricing conditions are applied to calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes ordered. I apologize for any confusion in my previous response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: Choice I will compute the incorrect price for numBoxes being greater than or equal to 5. For example, if numBoxes is 10, the first boolean expression will evaluate to true and totalCost will be assigned the correct price of 15. However, the second boolean expression will also evaluate to true, changing the value of totalCost to 30. The third boolean expression will also evaluate to true, changing the value of totalCost to 50.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this question, I selected option D, thinking that the second and third code segments would correctly assign the maximum element of the array to the variable `max`. However, the correct choice is actually option E, as all three code segments will always correctly assign the maximum element of the array to the variable `max`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Segment I uses a for-each loop and initializes `max` to the minimum integer value before iterating through the array to find the maximum.\n",
    "- Code Segment II initializes `max` to 0, and through a loop, iterates over the array while updating `max` if a larger value is encountered.\n",
    "- Code Segment III initializes `max` to the first element of the array and iterates through the array, updating `max` if a larger value is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: Choice I sets max to Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is the smallest possible integer value. Then it accesses each element in arr and assigns them value. If value is greater than max, max is assigned value since it is now the largest value so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 36: \n",
    "<img width=\"821\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-22 at 6 57 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/066d0d28-3b52-48d9-9600-5591224f1b83\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, I selected option C, thinking that the maximum number of times the statement indicated by `/ * Calculate midpoint * /` could execute would be 20. However, the correct choice is option D, which indicates that the maximum number of executions is 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided binary search method, the statement is executed within a while loop that continues until `start` is equal to `end` (the last possible iteration before termination). In the worst-case scenario where the target is not found, the loop will execute a maximum of 11 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collegeboard Explanation: The binary search eliminates half of the array during each iteration, as such you would need fewer iterations than 20.\n",

    "In approaching this problem, I initialized an ArrayList named students to store the names of students. Three strings (\"Alex\", \"Bob\", \"Carl\") were added to this list. The goal was to replace each student's name with \"Alex\" and then print the original names followed by the modified list of names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a for loop, each element in the list was replaced with \"Alex\" using students.set(k, \"Alex\"). The set method returned the original element, allowing me to print it followed by two spaces. After this loop, a for-each loop was used to print each modified element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this approach, the expected output after the first loop would be \"Alex Bob Carl \" because each element in the list was replaced with \"Alex\" during the loop, and the original elements were printed. Following this, the output after the second loop would be \"Alex Alex Alex \" since all elements in the list were set to \"Alex\" during the first loop.\n",

    "The analysis of the Java code problem pinpointed areas for improvement in my foundational understanding. Specifically, a brief confusion in the binary search algorithm emphasized the need for reinforcement in fundamental principles. Reflecting on the code segment highlighted the importance of a more systematic approach in testing environments and the value of regular, focused practice. The absence of a nested loop in the provided code emphasized the necessity to concentrate on problems involving nested constructs for more efficient problem-solving. While I demonstrated adaptability in unfamiliar concepts like De Morgan's law, targeted practice in this area and refining skills related to operations such as integer division would contribute to building a more robust foundation in Java programming. To progress, I aim to enhance my understanding of fundamental principles, adopt a structured approach to practice, concentrate on problems with nested loops, and dedicate focused practice to specific topics like De Morgan's law and integer division."
