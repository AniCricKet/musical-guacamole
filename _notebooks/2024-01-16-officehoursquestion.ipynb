    "3. In the second iteration, the midpoint is calculated as `(4 + 7) / 2 = 5`. Here, the `target (8)` is equal to `data[5]`, so the method returns `5` as the index where the target is found.\n",

    "As a result, the value returned by the call `binarySearch(values, target)` is `5`. This indicates that the target value `8` is found at index `5` in the given array `values`."
