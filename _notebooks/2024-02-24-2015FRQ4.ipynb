    "This question involves designing an interface called NumberGroup to represent a group of integers with a method named contains. The interface is intended to check if a given integer is part of the group. Following this, a class named Range is to be implemented, which represents a number group of integers within a specified range. The Range class, being a implementation of NumberGroup, includes instance variables, methods, and a constructor to handle the range of values. Lastly, a class called MultipleGroups is mentioned, which represents a collection of NumberGroup objects and itself is a NumberGroup. The task requires writing the contains method for MultipleGroups, checking if a given integer is present in one or more of the number groups stored in the instance variable groupList. To approach this, start by defining the NumberGroup interface with the specified contains method. Then, implement the Range class ensuring the proper handling of ranges. Lastly, for the MultipleGroups class, write the contains method by iterating through the groupList and checking each group for the given integer.\n",

    "## Part A:\n",
    "\n",
    "A number group represents a group of integers defined in some way. It could be empty, or it could contain one or more integers. Write an interface named NumberGroup that represents a group of integers. The interface should have a single contains method that determines if a given integer is in the group. For example, if group1 is of type NumberGroup, and it contains only the two numbers -5 and 3, then group1.contains(-5) would return true, and group1.contains(2) would return false. Write the complete NumberGroup interface. It must have exactly one method."

    "For this question, I had to create a class called MultipleGroups, which represents a collection of NumberGroup objects and implements the NumberGroup interface. The class stores its number groups in groupList and required a contains method that checks if a given integer is present in any of these groups. To achieve this, I iterated through each NumberGroup in groupList and used the contains method of each group to determine if the provided integer is contained within. The provided code also included a Main class with a main method showcasing the usage of the implemented classes: Range, MultipleGroups, and the NumberGroup interface. To come up with this solution, I had to look back on concepts from previous lessons, focusing on interface implementation, class structure, and list manipulation in Java."
