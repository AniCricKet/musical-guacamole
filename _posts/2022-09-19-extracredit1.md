# Notes

- the panelists were a mechanical engineering major, computer science major, cognitive science/machine learning major, and a environmental analysis major
- ap computer science knowledge helped succeed in college classes
- being exposed to linux, scripting, and powershell helped with an autonomous robotics class
- csa and csp teach valuable web dev skills which are useful in the workplace
- knowing how to use things like github, agile manifesto, scrum teams is very helpful
- topics in this class are very fundamental for other into level courses in college
- when applying for college, it's important to consider if it's a lottery or not (example: ucsd is a lottery for cs major), just apply to as many colleges as possible because there's no guarantee you'll get in anywhere
- cs is kinda hard to switch into, but cognitive science is also a good alternative along with data science
- working a job like Codeninjas or any extracurricular where u show a strong understanding of college (preferably a teaching position)
- putting your resume out there to family friends or on websites like indeed is good to find a job/internship opportunity
- references from people that work at the company look really good
- don't get discouraged if you don't get internships, it's very hard to get them 
- if your showing some kind of project you worked on during an application or an interview, it's better to show how it helped them overall 
- 2 of them interned at Northrupp Grumann
- knowledge from things like cyber patriot and having leadership from things like robotics is good to get internships like this
- you need to know which extracurricular is helpful and will benefit you and your application
- building a project during school is very impressive and is pretty doable
- these projects are really good if you want to apply for a computer science major or something related to that
- start with simple ideas because then you can show off a large amount of projects
- this project doesnt have to be something crazy, can be building off something that already exists like Uber
- Hyperplexed is a good youtube channel to see how to redesign big websites
- Learn how to use UI tools like Figma to make frontend as well
- AI tools like chatgpt can help build projects but don't be overreliant on them because they don't always work for all checked scenarios, but its good for exact errors
- deploy your projects online (like vercel or sum) so people can see it online
- having tangible projects to show impresses employers and gives them an idea of what kind of person you are
- keep some kind of a portfolio or an individual website linked to your linkedin
- on these websites have 3d models or things that you create which demonstrate computer knowledge
- also show lessons learned and maybe projects which are still in progress and what is the problem
- one of the panelists suggested doing thinks like leet code problems and knowing how to understand/tackle them over building a project during a school year, as these things are also helpful for internships and jobs
- a lot of jobs have an in-person coding assesment where u have to code a certain thing on the spot, so these things are really helpful

# Cheat codes:
tools to use if you're serious about publishing projects and building a strong portfolio
- Vercel: deploying tool for projects
- SvelteKit: web-development framework
- Tailwind CSS: frontend tool to customize styling easily
- just search up top 10 tools for a coding portfolio
- Personal website: buy a cheap domain for your own personal website and put your resume & projects on there
- Website should display lots of technical skills, as thats what employers are looking for (content doesn't matter)
- Picking up and understanding these tools while theyre still new is very impressive and puts you ahead of others
- however you should still focus on the fundamentals and make sure you understand the tools we use in class before you start working on these things
