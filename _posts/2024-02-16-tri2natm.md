### Two Trimester focus planning
Overall I think Night At The Museum was a successful experience, as I got to interact with various different people. Not everyone had a technical background, so it was good to get different kinds of feedback. Most kids were'n't that techie, so their suggestions were more about accessibility and styling, while the parents we interacted with, so they gave more suggestions about that or were asking how certain features worked. This was helpful as I had the opportunity to explain my feature and the tools I used. This helped me better understand and explain things better. We are grateful for the feedback that we got, and plan to implement those suggestions in the coming weeks.

### Blog / article on you and team
We interacted with a lot of people and these were the main suggestions that they gave:
- Making the frontend more visually appealing and connected, getting rid of random pages in the navbar, more colors, etc
- Connecting all features of our project by letting people make accounts and have profile pictures
- Having a working login page with roles so we can demo what the teacher will see vs what the student will see

### Blog on event
I was impressed to see the CSSE kids' platformer games as well as the projects of the kids from CSP. It's always good to reflect and see how they are doing and compare that to the projects I built last year. A lot of the CSP kids were interacting with us and asking us questions so it was good to see this ecosystem of crowd sourcing and help. 

As always, I was very impressed by the arts from various different art classes.


### 3D Animation
Here are a few pictures that impressed me from 3D Animation.

I haven't took this coure yet, but I plan to take it in the future so this was a good opportunity to see what some of the students are able to do, and gave me a bit of an incentive to take the course.

I definitely am not the most gifted when it comes to art however I am still a big fan of looking at good art pieces. Hence, I was really impressed by the quality of drawings these kids had made. Some of them looked so realistic it just blew my mind.

I'm not very familiar with how ceramics works, so it was really cool to see how students were able to create such unique shapes and also make them shiny.
