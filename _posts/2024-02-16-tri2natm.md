### Two Trimester focus planning
Overall I think Night At The Museum was a successful experience, as I got to interact with various different people. Not everyone had a technical background, so it was good to get different kinds of feedback. Most kids were'n't that techie, so their suggestions were more about accessibility and styling, while the parents we interacted with, so they gave more suggestions about that or were asking how certain features worked. This was helpful as I had the opportunity to explain my feature and the tools I used. This helped me better understand and explain things better. We are grateful for the feedback that we got, and plan to implement those suggestions in the coming weeks.

### Blog / article on you and team
We interacted with a lot of people and these were the main suggestions that they gave:
- Making the frontend more visually appealing and connected, getting rid of random pages in the navbar, more colors, etc
- Connecting all features of our project by letting people make accounts and have profile pictures
- Having a working login page with roles so we can demo what the teacher will see vs what the student will see
