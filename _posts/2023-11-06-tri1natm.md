I haven't took this coure yet, but I plan to take it in the future so this was a good opportunity to see what some of the students are able to do, and gave me a bit of an incentive to take the course.

I definetly am not the most gifted when it comes to art however I am still a big fan of looking at good art pieces. Hence, I was really impressed by the quality of drawings these kids had made. Some of them looked so realistic it just blew my mind.

I'm not very familiar with how ceramics works, so it was really cool to see how students were able to create such unique shapes and also make them shiny.

### And last but certainly not the least...

# AP Computer Science!!!

Here are some photos I took of projects that impressed me.

After being focused on my project and my project alone, it was fascinating to see other people's projects and to see the code behind them, as everyone did their frontend/backend link slightly differently. It was also good to learn that everyone was struggling with the CORS errors, so it was good to learn how they overcame those. Some people also asked interesting questions about our project, which made me rethink certain features, so there are parts of my project that I want to improve. Because of this, night at the museum was a very enjoyable experience from which I also had numerous takeaways.
