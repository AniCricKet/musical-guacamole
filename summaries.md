| 1    | We began our journey in CSA by setting up a new Github Pages. For me, the biggest challenge was getting the theme to work, as it looked wonky and the theme wouldn't cover the whole page. I also had some problems where my index page was looping and I had random characters on my home page which I couldn't locate in my repository. But after a lot of trial and error, I was able to fix these problems and successfully deploy on Github Pages. |
| 2    | In this week I tested if certain functions of the blog were working. First I tested to see if certain jupyter notebooks were working, and then I made a simple javascript tic-tac-toe game to test if frontend games were working. |
| 3    | This week I worked on becoming more familiar with Programming in Javascript by tweaking the calculator, snake, and life game. |
