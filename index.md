| Week 0 | Tools & GH Pages Setup | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/issues/1) | We began our journey in CSA by setting up a new Github Pages. For me, the biggest challenge was getting the theme to work, as it looked wonky and the theme wouldn't cover the whole page. I also had some problems where my index page was looping and I had random characters on my home page which I couldn't locate in my repository. But after a lot of trial and error, I was able to fix these problems and succesfully deploy on AWS.|
